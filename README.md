# kaggle_archive

This repository is an archive that centrally manages and stores the code from the Kaggle competitions I have participated in. Each directory contains the code, analysis methods, and experimental results corresponding to each competition.

## Purpose

- **Review and Learning:** To reflect on past projects and consolidate ideas for future improvements.
- **Information Sharing:** To serve as a resource that can be reused by peers tackling similar challenges, as well as for my own reference.

## Directory Structure

Each directory corresponds to a specific Kaggle competition.  
For example, it includes directories such as `amex_default_prediction`, `commonlit_2023`, and `m5_forecasting_accuracy`.
